## Game rules

You'll be assigned randomly a player from this list: owl, fox, snake, bear, golden eagle or monkey. Each caracter has specific skills that can be useful to defeat your enemies or move on the map.<br><br>
There are three rounds in total:<br>
- <strong>Round 1:</strong><br> You can move on the map to collect items, enter in a battle or trade items.<br>Every two moves, the map will change from day to night. At night, you can't see the items, battles or trade spots.However, depending on the player you have, you can have special skills which enable you to see one specific category at night - or nothing at all.<br>
- <strong>Round 2:</strong><br> You can buy and sell items at the squirrel shop to improve your inventory.<br>It is also time to team up with two other caracters in order to be strong enough to defeat the final monster.<br>
- <strong>Round 3:</strong><br> It is time to defeat The Tiger to win the game!
